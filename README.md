# TrainingStats
TrainingStats is a Java application to digitize your gym data. It is possible to save 
each training session. It requires the date you worked out, the exercises you did, the 
repetitions, weight and sets. From this data you can create a PDF for each exercise over 
a desire period of time. The PDF contains three scales to see your progress and a table with all your data.
I implemented this application for my own usage. This is the reason why not everything is perfect.

## Installation
It is no installation necessary. You can just download the TrainingStats.jar from the root folder of the git repository.
I recommend to create a folder and safe the jar in there, because it will create some text files to safe your training #
data. 

## Example
If you interested how a generated PDF can be. You can just have a look into TrainingsData.pdf in the root folder
of the git repository.
