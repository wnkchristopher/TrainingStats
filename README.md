# TrainingStats
TrainingStats is a Java application to digitize your gym data. It is possible to save 
each training session. It requires the date you worked out, the exercises you did, the 
repetitions, weight and sets. From this data you can create a PDF for each exercise over 
a desire period of time. The PDF contains three scales to see your progress and a table with all your data.

## Installation
It is no installation necessary. You can just download the TrainingStats.jar from the root folder of the git repository.
I recommend to create a folder and safe the jar in there, because it will create some text files to safe your training data. 

## Example
If you are interested in how a generated PDF can look like there is an example in the root folder of the git repository. It is called TrainingsData.pdf.
