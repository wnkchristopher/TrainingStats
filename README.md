# TrainingStats
TrainingStats is a Java application to digitize your gym data. It is possible to save 
each training session. It requires the date you worked out, the exercises you did, the 
repetitions, weight and sets. From this data you can create a PDF for each exercise over 
a desire period of time. I implemented this application for my own usage. This is the reason
why not everything is perfect.
